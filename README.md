# PHPStorm-SpacePeacock v1.5

A Sublime Text total-conversation for PHPStorm. With colors based on [SpaceGray](http://kkga.github.io/spacegray/) and [Peacocks in Space](https://github.com/daylerees/colour-schemes/blob/master/PeacocksInSpace.tmTheme) and Sublime Text keymappings.

## Color Theme

Definitely use this with the Darcula theme. Unfortunately, a fundamental lack of customization in PHPStorm prevents me from being able to clean up the project bar, or adjust the colors. I did recently get a hot tip on how to customize the icons, so I'll be going down that road shortly... My goal there is to either completely remove them, or if that's not possible, dramatically reduce the amount of individual icon types.

The syntax color scheme has only been designed for 'general' and 'PHP', so far. I'll be updating HTML etc eventually.

## Installation

- Download this project (or just the .jar file) to your computer.

- In PHPStorm, choose File -> Import Settings, and import the .jar file. (If you don't see the File menu, you may need to open a directory or a project first.)

- Install the plugin [ColorIDE](http://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7055?pr) to set the colors of the rest of the IDE.

- (optional) Install the plugin [Idea11 Icon Pack](http://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7285?pr=) to reduce the fugly in the sidebar.

- If you are using OSX then you need import `PHPStorm-SpacePeacock-osx-key-mappings.jar` after importing the main theme. This will fix your OSX specific keybindings.

## Fonts

Use Java 7 if you want the best font rendering on Linux possible.

The font used is Source Code Pro. I tried other fonts that I prefer such as DejaVu Sans Mono, but Java 7 didn't render them so hot. So, I stuck with that one.

The font size may be a bit big when you import. Sorry about that, I'm running 2560x1440 and I'm exporting new versions of the configuration so often that it's just better to leave it at my current settings. But, it's just a single configuration to fix it for your preference.

## Key Maps

The key mapping has been updated to better fit Sublime Text conventions. Because I didn't think that `ctrl + shift + alt + t` is a reasonable key combination for something as frequently used as **Refactor This**.

Additionally, "search everywhere" HAD to be changed because double-tapping left-shift is a two stroke trigger. This is a problem because as you're working the IDE will be busy with analyzing, indexing, and all of the things that IDEs do. If it's busy when you try to hit the first left-shift, then the second left-shift won't pop up the window. As far as user interfaces go, you should never have any lack of confidence that an action will trigger the appropriate response. Once you have that, you have to visually check each operation which is slow and creates cognitive overhead. Consequently, this was changed to `ctrl + p` (also to match Sublime Text) which completely removes this problem.

`ctrl + p` search everywhere

`ctrl + r` search methods in current file

`ctrl + alt + p` change projects

`ctrl + shift + enter` complete current statement

`ctrl + alt + enter` refactor this

`alt + enter` show intended actions (intentions are one of my favorite part JetBrains software)

`ctrl + n` new thing dialog

`ctrl + shift + F` reformat code

There are others, as I think of them, I'll add them here.


## Coming Soon

My goal is to replace the IDE colors with colors that match the scheme. Also, I'm going to either remove the project sidebar icons (folder and file icons) completely, or if that's not possible, come up with a simple and unobtrusive folder / file icon and replace them as necessary to clean up that sidebar.
